Simple example of deploy script that will help you to install LAMP on Centos Machine

## LAMP Deploy Script for CentOS 6.5/6.6 systems
Very 'raw' version of LAMP Deploy Script.
LAMP Deploy Script - written with Python 2.7 and should run "out of the box" on CentOS 6.5/6.6 systems.
Script was written to help web developers and any new user in Linux to deploy his own, ready to use web server.
In one click user can install Apache, MySQL and PHP.

## What script should do?
- Add EPEL & IUS repository to the system
- Install latest and stable Apache web server
- Install MySQL Community Server Repository
- Install latest and stable MySQL Community Server
- Install all necessary PHP packages
- Install LAMP stack in one click on your server

Script also has support of "Additional tools" that do:
- Check version of your system
- Check if you are connected to the Internet
- Check your local IP address
- Check your local host name

## To do list:
- To add full support of Centos 7 (both LEMP & LAMP stacks)
- To add LEMP stack (Linux, NGinx, MySQL, PHP-FPM with FastCGI)
- <strike>To add option `1-click install LAMP stack`</strike>
- To add option `1-click install LEMP stack`
- <strike>To add option `Additional tools`</strike>
- Different versions of PHP 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6

- CSF - ConfigServer Security & Firewall (optional)
- Support of `PhpMyAdmin`
- Create one binary file by using Cython library (optional)
- To add full support of Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 LTS (optional)

## How-to use
For now, script contains only 3 files written on Python:
* MainDeploy.py
* Centos6Deploy.py
* Centos7Deploy.py

You should run `MainDeploy.py` to see "Welcome Screen"
LAMP Deploy Script has been checked only on 64-bit CentOS 6.5 & 6.6, you should avoid to use on 32-bit server.
Script will not run, if you don't use CentOS 6.5/6.6 for now....
